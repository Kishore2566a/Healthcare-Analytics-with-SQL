# Healthcare-Analytics-with-SQL
This project involves analyzing healthcare data to derive insights about patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments using advanced SQL techniques. The goal was to apply SQL queries to generate meaningful reports and analytics within a healthcare context.
## Tools Used:
- **Data Analysis**: SQL
- ## Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered healthcare data from various tables (patients, doctors, appointments, etc.).
2. **Data Transformation**: Performed SQL joins, subqueries, and window functions to analyze data.
3. **Reports Generation**: Created SQL reports to summarize key healthcare metrics (e.g., doctor performance, patient demographics).
4. **Insights Generation**: Derived actionable insights to improve healthcare management and operational efficiency.
## Project Outcome:
The analysis provided insights into doctor performance, patient histories, and treatment trends, offering actionable recommendations for improving healthcare services.
